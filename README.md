some stuff about python

ordereddict.py => a class which create a sortable dictionnary

frange.py => a function that works exactly like a range but suitable for floats. It's not my work, please thank pythoncentral.io

euclideannorm.py => calculate the euclidean norm of 2 integers or in the case of lists/tuples, a multidimentional norm.
